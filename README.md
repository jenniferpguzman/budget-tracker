# Jennifers Budget Tracker
## Add in your income and Expenses to track how much you will be left over with!
This budget tracker allows you to input your incomes. It will also allow you to add your expenses and add descriptions to both so you know what you're spending on. 
After adding them in, you will see in the summary your total income, your total expenses and your balance left over.
Once you have your income/expenses and budget you can clear the values by pressing the clear button at the bottom. This will reset it for you to put any new fields you need to! 
# Styling
The styling for this budget tracker was used using SASS, adding colors to create a gradient for the background of the UI. 
Only using two main colors for the texts/buttons. 
# JavaScript
Using JavaScript I created classes and used methods to add income.expenses and clear the values.
I used eventlisteners that way when you clicked on the buttons it will add the values/ clear the values. 
Also adding both income and expenses into list by using appendChild().
